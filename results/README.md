# Results Directory

This is the repository directory where you should save and commit your
predicted `p_factor` values as a TSV file prior to issuing a pull request for
your results. Instructions and example code for doing this can be found in the
sample notebook in the root of the repository.

When you save your results TSV file, make sure to name the results file after
your group (feel free to come up with a group name). Once you have saved the
file, you should commit it, push it to GitHub, then submit a pull request from
your repository to the `results` branch of the [original repository](
https://github.com/NeuroHackademy2025/rbc-projects-template).


To make our p_factor predictions, we selected all the gray matter volume regions in the PNC_FreeSurfer dataset, since that was the preprocessed anatomical outputs. From that, we narrowed down the specific characteristics we wanted are - age, sex, and the 3 behavioral metrics: internalizing_mcelroy_harmonized_all_samples, externalizing_mcelroy_harmonized_all_samples, attention_mcelroy_harmonized_all_samples. We then used a LinearRegression model to train and test our model.
